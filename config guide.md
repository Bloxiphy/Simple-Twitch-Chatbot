# This is the guide to fill out the quotes in [config.json](https://github.com/Bloxiphy/Simple-Twitch-Chatbot/blob/main/config.json).
-----------

> `channel` = the channel where the bot should work on, example: `"channel" = "Bloxiphy"`
-------------------
> `username` = the username of the bot, example: `"username" = "BloxiB0T"`
-------------------
> `password` = the oauth chat token that the bot requires to chat using tmi, example: `"password" = "oauth:m4pt2q7vr3hk6zpb08hyc359la8x0". 
**to get this password, go to [this link](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) and get your token from there. make sure you log into your bot's account and not anything else.**
